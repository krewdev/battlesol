# Gemini API Key for AI opponent
# Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
# Replace PLACEHOLDER_API_KEY with your actual API key
API_KEY=PLACEHOLDER_API_KEY

# For development, you can use the fallback AI which doesn't require an API key
# The game will work without the API key but will use simpler AI logic
